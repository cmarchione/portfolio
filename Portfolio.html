            <img src="D:\School Work\GitHub\portfolio\img\mechanic.jpg" alt="mechanic">
            <p>ME.Chanic is a protype for an app that I worked on in my Human-Computer Interactive Design course fall semester 2014.<p>
            <p>During the process of creating the prototype, I worked with a few different programs to help create the wireframes and actual design of the app. I became very familiar and comfortable with the interface design process through the protoype creation. </p>
            

            <h2>NYS Renters Rights Guide</h2>

            <p>Albany Law School worked with my Intermediate Interactive Design class in the fall semester of 2014 to create a website that informs users of their rights while renting a house in New York State. Our class was broken up into teams and each team had to create a website for this topic and at the end of the semester the best one would be actually used by Albany Law School.</p>
            <p>I held the position of Project Manager for my team throughout the semester for this project. However, I also took on the role of designing and developing the website. </p>


            <h2>John Herbert Company</h2>

            <p>This website was created by myself as a final project for the first web developing class I took at Albany.</p>
            <p>John Herbert Company is a construction company that I worked for over the summer and while I was on break from school. I knew that their current website was really outdated and it was time for an upgrade. That was my main motive for choosing this for my final project. Over the summer after classes ended I worked with the owner to gather all the content for the website so we could get it posted as soon as possible. </p>
            <p>This site is still a work in progress as I am working towards making it responsive. After this past semester I strengthened my skills for creating responsive web design and the owner of JHC agreed to postpone switching the sites until I finished making it responsive. </p>
